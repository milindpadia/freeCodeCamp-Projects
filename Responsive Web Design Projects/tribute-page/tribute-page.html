          <h3>The life and work of Swami Vivekanand:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><b>1863</b> - Narendranath Dutt (later and more commonly known as Swami Vivekanand) was born on 12th January 1863 in Calcutta, India. His father, Vishwanath Dutt, was a successful lawyer who, along with Narendranath’s mother, Bhubaneswari Devi, ensured that their son received the education necessary for a professional career in British-ruled India.</li>
            <li><b>1884</b> - His father died in 1884. This strengthened Narendranath’s ties with Hindu ascetic, Swami Ramkrishna Paramhans. Narendranath continued his education, but eventually lost interest in a professional career, focusing on Ramkrishna's teachings.</li>
            <li><b>1886</b> - After falling ill in October 1885, Swami Ramkrishna died on 16th August 1886 having been nursed until his death by his group of disciples, who then dispersed. After finishing law school that same year, Narendranath located a house in Baranagar which became a monastery dedicated to Ramkrishna's teachings.</li>
            <li><b>1892</b> - After meeting while visiting sacred sites on the western coast, the Raja of Khetri urged Narendranath to take the name "Swami Vivekanand", a name suitable for a Hindu ascetic.</li>
            <li><b>1893</b> - Vivekanand sailed from Bombay in May 1893 to attend the World Parliament of Religions in Chicago in September. His powerful speech made a dramatic impression on the audience and provoked considerable comment in the American press.</li>
            <li><b>1895</b> - Vivekanand remained in the United States touring, lecturing, and writing extensively until he was invited to London by the theosophists Henrietta Müller and E. T. Sturdy, where he continued his intense schedule of lecturing and teaching.</li>
            <li><b>1896</b> - Vivekanand established the Vedant Society of New York in 1896 under the presidency of one of his disciples, Francis H. Legget.</li>
            <li><b>1897</b> - After returning to Calcutta in January, Vivekananda established the Ramakrishna Mission. The organisation was devoted to social service, instituting a famine relief fund, founding an orphanage, and opening a Ramakrishna ashrama at Sagachhi shortly afterwards. Vivekananda also encouraged the publication of Bengali-language fortnightly paper, Ubodhan, with the first issue being published on 14th January 1899. The Ramakrishna Mission is active today throughout the world as a charitable and educational organization. </li>
            <li><b>1901</b> - After embarking on a tour of Europe and travelling across the United States from June 1899 to December 1900, Vivekananda returned to Belur Math to transfer management and presidency of the mission across to the board of trustees who elected Swami Brahmananda as the next president.</li>
            <li><b>1902</b> - After setting off on a pilgrimage through East Bengal and Assam, poor health forced Vivekananda to settle at the Belur Math, where he died on 4th July 1902.</li>
          </ul>
